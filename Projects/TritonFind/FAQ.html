			<h3> General Questions </h3>
			<p class="question"> How do you work? </p>
			<p class="answer"> Okay, this is how it generally goes down. 
				<ol> 
					<li>You register an item through TritonFind by sending 
					the bot a picture of the item's barcode 
					(usually your student ID)</li>
					<li>You accidentally lose your ID. Some generous soul finds it.</li>
					<li>They send a picture of the barcode to TritonFind. 
					TritonFind recognizes it as yours, and connects you two 
					through Messenger. </li>
					<li>You two talk it out, and find out how to return your item.
					(see our list of reccommended ways of doing this).</li>
					<li>Your item is returned and your day is saved! </li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			
			<p class="question">Isn't this useless if noone uses it?</p>
			<p class="answer"> Yes, it is. Which is why it is imperative that 
			sign up for it. <br> Think about it - It takes only about 30 seconds
			to register your student ID or items with TritionFind. After that, 
			you can ignore it forever. But there may be a time in the future 
			where you desperately need to find your item: maybe Sun God is 
			tomorrow and you need your ID, or you're locked out of your room, 
			or you're scared someone is stealing your dining dollars. 
			<br> TritonFind will give your mind ease. Sure, you may never use it,
			but when you absolutely <u>need</u> it, it will be there.

			<h3>TroubleShooting</h3>
			<p class="question"> How come it's not recognizing my barcode? </p>
			<p class="answer"> In order for TritonFind to find a barcode in 
			a photo you send it, the following must be true:
				<ol>
					<li> The picture must be in <strong>portrait</strong>. </li>
					<li> There must be <strong>ample lighting.</strong> </li>
					<li> The picture must be <strong>clear</strong>, every bar
					on the barcode must distinguishable. </li>
					<li> The barcode should be fairly <strong>large</strong>. </li>
					<li> The barcode must be in the right <strong>format</strong>.</li>
				</ol>
					
					<p>These are the types of barcode formats that TritonFind
					accepts (from the <a href="https://www.zxing.org">
					zxing website</a>).<p>

					<ul>
						<li> UPC-A and UPC-E</li>
						<li> EAN-8 and EAN-13</li>
						<li> Code 39</li>
						<li> Code 93</li>
						<li> Code 128</li>
						<li> ITF</li>
						<li style="color:red"> Codabar</li>
						<li> RSS-14 (all variants)</li>
						<li> RSS Expanded (most variants)</li>
						<li> QR Code</li>
						<li> Data Matrix</li>
						<li> Aztec ('beta' quality)</li>
						<li> PDF 417 ('alpha' quality)</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Because a majority of TritonFind barcodes are UC San 
					Diego studnet ID's, TritonFind prefers CODABAR barcodes. If
					you wish to scan something other than a UC San Diego ID, 
					all you have to do is confirm that you are <u>not</u> scanning
					a UC San Diego ID when taking a picture.</p>

			<h3>Security/Data Protection</h3>
			<p class="question"> How do I know you won't steal my UCSD PID? </p>
			<p class="answer"> The barcode on the back of a UCSD ID does not 
			coorespond to your actual UCSD PID. There may be an internal list
			that UCSD keeps to connect those, but TritonFind does not have
			the ability to do that. <br>We also reccomend that you take a look
			at the <a href="privacy.html">TritonFind Privacy Policy</a>. We 
			detail exactly how we deal with your potentially secret information.</p>

			<h3>About TritionFind</h3>
			<p class="question"> Who made this? </p>
			<p class="answer"> Hi, my name is Alex Garcia! I'm a Computer 
			Engineering Major at UC San Diego. I spend my summer learning how to 
			work with the Messenger Bot API. I've never used nodejs or html or
			anything before (which you might be able to tell by this 90's website),
			but I enjoy learning this. <a href="../../Contact/index.html">Here</a> is my 
			contact information. If you want to learn how to build a Messenger 
			Bot like this, feel free to contact me anytime!</p>

			<p class="question">How did you make this? </p>
			<p class="answer">TritionFind is built upon a Heroku app that 
			communicates with Messenger through the <a href="TODO dont forget this plz">
			Messenger Bot API</a>. It is written in NodeJS. <a href="lol TODO this too plz">Here</a>
			is the code TritonFind is built out of.
