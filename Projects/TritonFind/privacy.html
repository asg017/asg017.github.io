	<h1> TritonFind Privacy Policy </h1>
	<p id="subtitle"> Your privacy is important to us. Here is how we protect it. </p>

	<h2> Data Collection </h2>
	<p> TritonFind collects and uses data from a variety of sources. These are the specfic places we use. </p>
	<h3> Data From Facebook </h3>

	<p> TritonFind can access the following information from users, courtesy of the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/user-profile">Messenger Bot API Platform</a>:
		<ul>
			<li> First Name </li>
			<li> Last Name </li>
			<li> Gender </li>
			<li> Profile Picture </li>
			<li> locale (e.g. "US-en") </li>
			<li> Timezone </li>
		</ul>
	<p> The only information TritonFind actually accesses a user's <strong>First Name</strong>, <strong>Last Name</strong>, and <strong>Profile Picture</strong>. </p>

	<p> TritonFind uses a persons <strong>first name</strong> for two reasons:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Personalize Messages</li>
			<li>Share with another user</li>
		</ol>

	<p>When we share a person's first name with another person, it is done with permission of said user. If a user finds a lost item, they choose to send a "conversation invite" to the owner. This is the explicit permission a user gives to share their first name with the owner. Also, if one receives a "conversation invite," if they accept the invite, that is the explicit permission they give to TritonFind to share their first name with the other user. </p>
		
	<p> TritonFind also accesses a person's <strong>last name</strong>. For now, it is not used, but may be used in the future. </p>
	<p> TritonFind uses a person's <strong>Facebook profile picture</strong>. If a user is in a conversation with another user through TritionFind (in order to communicate on an items whereabouts), they have the option to send the other user their profile picture (in order to show them what they look like). This is only done with explicit person from the user, they must purposefully choose the option to send the other person their own profile picture.

	<p>TritonFind does not store any information that has been gathered by the Messenger User Profile API. So, we do not store anyone's first name, last name, or profile picture. It is only accessed when needed, never stored.</p>


	<h3> Data From Users </h3>

		<p> TritonFind receives much of its data from users themselves. Users can send TritonFind pictures, barcodes, texts, photos, or even their location. Here are all of sources of data TritonFind receives, and what TritonFind does with them. </p>

		<h4>Messenger Messages</h4>

			<p>TritonFind communicates all through Messenger. All messages can be viewed in TritonFind's Facebook Page Messages. However, the TritonFind team will only access these messages under the following circumstances:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>LiveChat with users</li>
				<li>Debugging TritonFind</li>
				<li>Investigate Reports</li>
				<li>Comply with Law Enforcement</li>
			</ul>

			<strong><u>LiveChat</u></strong>
			<p>Users have the option to join in a live chat with the TritonFind team. Once a user requests for a LiveChat (to discuss TritonFind functionality, ask questions, file reports, etc.), the TritonFind team may access this person's messages on TritonFind. </p>

			<strong><u>Debugging</u></strong>
			<p>Sometimes, TritonFind does not work the way it should be. So, our team may access the TritonFind Page Messages to see what went wrong. However, we will only access our own Messaging threads, and not view other users' messages. That will only be done with explicit permission from said users.</p>
			<strong><u>Reports</u></strong>
			<p>Users may break the <a href="terms.html">TritonFind Terms of Service</a> during conversation with other users. So, if a user files a report against another user, the TritonFind team may access the messages threads of all parties affiliated with the report filed. Our team will keep any information seen as confidential.</p>
			
			<strong><u>Law Enforcement</u></strong>
			<p>If any local law enforcement agencies request specified threads for their own investigations, TritonFind will comply.<p>
		
		<h4>Pictures And Barcodes</h4>
		<p> TritonFind's main functionality rests on its ability to read and save barcodes from pictures sent by users. The TritonFind team strives to keep this information safe and secure. </p>
		<p>TritonFind stores all barcode information in a database. This information will never be used by the TritonFind team, for any purposes. The data is never accessed for any reason by our team. Item information can be deleted by a user at any time. We also reccommed that users delete photos sent to TritonFind, for extra security.</p>
		<p>Pictures sent to TritonFind are not stored, either. They can be accessed through the TritonFind Facebook Page Messages, but will only be accessed by the TritonFind team in the instances labelled above.</p>

		<h4>Location</h4>
		<p>TritonFind gives the option of a user sharing their location with another user. This is done when the two users are in a conversation, trying to return a lost item. A user must explicitly send their location to TritonFind, and TritonFind will relay the location to the user other. Locations are never stored on TritonFind's side.</p>
	
	<h3>Logging</h3>
	<p>TritonFind logs much of its activity, through Heroku's logging system. This is done in order to debug and mantain TritonFind's many features. <br>
	This can, however, cause some privacy issues. some message information may be logged during TritonFind activity. However, the TritonFind team will only access these logs only when necessary to debug and mantain TritonFind. These logs are stored securely, and automatically get deleted after a certain amount of time.</p>

	<h2>Updates</h2>
	<p>When TritonFind's Privacy Policy changes in a significant way, we will alert our users through a TritonFind Facebook Page post. We will also utilize the TritonFind Announcement system to let our users know on Messenger. 

	<h2>Contact</h2>
	<p>If you feel that the TritonFind team is not abiding by this privacy policy, please send us a message through TritionFind and request to LiveChat. Alternatively, you can find our contact information <a href="contact.html">here</a>.</p>
