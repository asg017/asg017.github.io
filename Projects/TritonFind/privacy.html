	<h1> TritonFind Privacy Policy </h1>
	<p id="subtitle"> Your privacy is important to us. Here is how we protect it. </p>

	<h2> I - Data Collection </h2>
	<p> TritonFind collects and uses data from a variety of sources. 
	These are the specfic sources. </p>


	<h3> I.I - Data From Facebook </h3>
	<p> TritonFind can access the following information from users, courtesy of the 
	<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/user-profile">
	Messenger Bot API Platform</a>:

		<ul>
			<li> First Name </li>
			<li> Last Name </li>
			<li> Gender </li>
			<li> Profile Picture </li>
			<li> locale (e.g. "US-en") </li>
			<li> Timezone </li>
		</ul>

	<p> The only information TritonFind actually accesses a user's 
	<strong>First Name</strong>, <strong>Last Name</strong>, and
	<strong>Profile Picture</strong>. </p>

	<p> TritonFind uses a persons <strong>first name</strong> for two reasons:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Personalize Messages</li>
			<li>Share with another user</li>
		</ol>
	<p>When we share a person's first name with another person, it is done 
	with permission of the user. If a user finds a lost item, they choose to 
	send a "conversation invite" to the owner. This is the explicit permission 
	a user gives to share their first name with the owner. Also, if one receives 
	a "conversation invite," if they accept the invite, that is the explicit 
	permission they give to TritonFind to share their first name with the other user. </p>
		
	<p> TritonFind also accesses a person's <strong>last name</strong>. 
	This is only used in the reporting feature, so the TritonFind team can 
	easily investigate wrong-doings with TritonFind. </p>

	<p> TritonFind uses a person's <strong>Facebook profile picture</strong>. 
	If a user is in a conversation with another user through TritionFind 
	(in order to communicate on an item's whereabouts), they have the option 
	to send the other user their profile picture (in order to show them what 
	they look like). This is only done with explicit person from the user, 
	they must purposefully choose the option to send the other person 
	their own profile picture.</p>

	<p>TritonFind does not store any information that has been gathered by the 
	Messenger User Profile API. So, we do not store anyone's first name, 
	last name, or profile picture. It is only accessed when needed, never stored.</p>



	<h3>I.II - Data From Users </h3>

		<p> TritonFind receives much of its data from users themselves. Users 
		can send TritonFind pictures, barcodes, texts, photos, or even their 
		location. Here are all of sources of data TritonFind receives from users,
		and what TritonFind does with them. </p>


		<h4>I.II.I - Messenger Messages</h4>

			<p>TritonFind communicates all through Messenger. All messages can 
			be viewed in TritonFind's Facebook Page Messages. However, the 
			TritonFind team will only access these messages under the following 
			circumstances:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>LiveChat with users</li>
				<li>Debugging TritonFind</li>
				<li>Investigate Reports</li>
				<li>Comply with Law Enforcement</li>
			</ul>

			<h5>I.II.I.I - LiveChat</h5>
			<p>Users have the option to join in a "LiveChat" with the TritonFind 
			team. Once a user requests for a LiveChat (to discuss TritonFind 
			functionality, ask questions, file reports, etc.), the TritonFind 
			team may access this person's messages on TritonFind. </p>


		<h5>I.II.I.II - Debugging</h5>
			<p>Sometimes, TritonFind does not work the way it should be. So, 
			our team may access the TritonFind Page Messages to see what went 
			wrong. However, we will only access our own Messenger threads, and 
			not view other users' messages. That will only be done with explicit 
			permission from said users.</p>


			<h5>I.II.I.III - Reports</h5>
			<p>Users may break the 
			<a href="terms.html">TritonFind Terms of Service</a> during 
			conversation with other users. So, if a user files a report against 
			another user, the TritonFind team may access the Messenger threads of 
			all parties affiliated with the report filed, in order to properly 
			investigate reports. Our team will keep any information seen as 
			confidential.</p>
			
			<h5>I.II.I.IV - Law Enforcement</h5>
			<p>If any local law enforcement agencies request specific threads 
			for their own investigations, TritonFind will comply.<p>
		

		<h4>I.II.II Pictures And Barcodes</h4>
		<p> TritonFind's main functionality rests on its ability to read and 
		save barcodes from pictures sent by users. The TritonFind team strives 
		to keep this information safe and secure. </p>

		<p>TritonFind stores all barcode information in a database. This 
		information will never be used or viewed by the TritonFind team, at any 
		time or for any purpose. Item information 
		can be deleted by a user at any time. We also recommend that users 
		delete photos sent to TritonFind, for extra security.</p>

		<p>Pictures sent to TritonFind are not stored, either. They can be 
		accessed through the TritonFind Facebook Page Messages, but will only be 
		accessed by the TritonFind team in the instances labelled above.</p>

		<h5 id="barcode-secuirty">Small Note on Storing UC San Diego ID Card Barcode Data</h5>

		<p>TritonFind may be used by students of UC San Diego to scan their 
		student ID's. Despite TritonFind's profound attempts at security and 
		safety, some users may still be uncomfortable with TritonFind's data 
		storage. So far, in TritonFind's research, the barcode on the back of a 
		UC San Diego student ID is only used in the following ways:
			
		<ol>
			<li>Signing up for Sun God</li>
			<li>Accessing Library Accounts</li>
		</ol>

		<p>To register for Sun God (as seen in <a href="https://signedevents.com/united-states/la-jolla/sun-god-festival-2016/">
		this archived page</a>), one must give their name, PID, and barcode on 
		the back of their ID. Since TritonFind has no way of recieving one's PID,
		UC San Diego students should not be cautious of registering their ID 
		due fraudulent Sun God registration. </p>

		<p>To register for a UC San Diego Library Account, one must give register
		with the same code that TritonFind scans. If a TritonFind user is wary of
		this connection, despite TritonFind priority on security, they can simply 
		attach a password to this library account. This will make your library
		account secure. Now, some older UC San Diego Library services may only
		require that barcode code to utilize certain resources. We would again 
		reiterate TrintonFind's priority for security, and mention that 
		<a href="#data-breach"> 
		TritonFind will contact all users in case of a data breach.</a> </p>

		<p>However, in general, as long as one takes necessary precautions to 
		secure their library account, UC San Diego students should not be 
		cautious of registering their ID due to nefarious library account accesses. </p>

		<p>You may also check out the TritonFind <a href="barcodeSafety.html">security
		reseach</a> to better understand TritonFind's attempts at securing your data.</p>

		<h4>I.II.II - Location</h4>
		<p>TritonFind gives the option of a user sharing their location with 
		another user. This is done when the two users are in a conversation, 
		trying to return a lost item. A user must explicitly send their location 
		to TritonFind, and TritonFind will relay the location to the user other. 
		Locations are never stored on TritonFind's side.</p>
	
	<h3>I.III - Logging</h3>
	<p>TritonFind logs much of its activity, through Heroku's logging system. 
	This is done in order to debug and mantain TritonFind's many features. <br>

	This can, however, cause some privacy issues. some message information may 
	be logged during TritonFind activity. However, the TritonFind team will only
	access these logs only when necessary to debug and mantain TritonFind. 
	These logs are stored securely, and automatically get deleted after a 
	certain amount of time.</p>

	<h2 id="data-breach">II - In Case of Data Breach</h2>
	<p>In case of any data breaches on TritonFind's end, the TritonFind team 
	will attempt to notify all subscribed users of the breach's severity, scope, 
	and future prevention. If specific users are effected, the TritonFind team 
	will contact said users. We will attempt to notify users be use of: </p>
	<ol>
		<li>TritonFind's Announcement System (all subscribed TritonFind users)</li>
		<li>Facebook Post on TritonFind's Page (all users who have "liked" the page)</li>
	</ol>


	<h2>III - Updates</h2>
	<p>When TritonFind's Privacy Policy changes in a significant way, we will 
	alert our users through a TritonFind Facebook Page post. We will also utilize
	the TritonFind Announcement system to let our subscribed users know on Messenger. 

	<h2>IV - Contact</h2>
	<p>If you feel that the TritonFind team is not abiding by this privacy
	policy or have any questions/concerns, please send us a message through 
	TritionFind and request a LiveChat.	Alternatively, you can find our contact
	information <a href="contact.html">here</a>.</p>
