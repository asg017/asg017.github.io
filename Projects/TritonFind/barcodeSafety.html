<h1>Why should I trust you with my information?</h1>
<p id="subtitle">The TritonFind team understands if you are weary of TritonFind's
	data collection. In addition to our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>,
	here are the additional steps we (and you) can take to keep your info private.</p>

<div id="TLDR">
<p>Too Long, Didn't Read: </p>
<ol>
	<li>TritonFind information is kept in a secure database.</li>
	<li>TritonFind takes extra steps to keep your info safe in case of data breaches.</li>
	<li>There are <a href="#whatcan-i-do">extra steps</a> you can take to 
	     secure your data even more.</li>
	<li>In general, you should be more worried about UCSD security than TritonFind's.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div id="barcode-info">
<h2>What does the barcode on the back of my UCSD ID even do?</h2>

<p>First clarification, the barcode on the back of your ID does <u>NOT</u> 
	correspond your PID.</p>

<p>Your PID starts with a letter (usually "A"), and grants you access to most your 
	UCSD accounts and services.</p>

<p>The barcode on the back of your ID is all numbers (starts with "21822...") 
	and helps you access some services from UCSD. It is completely unique to your
	current physical ID (if you lose your ID, your new ID would have a new barcode number).</p>


<p>Second, here is a list that TritonFind has created on all the possible uses 
	for the barcode on the back of your ID:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Register for Sun God (
			<a href="https://signedevents.com/united-states/la-jolla/sun-god-festival-2016/">
			archived link</a>)</li>
		<li>Access your <a href="https://roger.ucsd.edu/patroninfo">UCSD Library Account</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://libraries.ucsd.edu/spaces/reserve/">
			Reserve a group study room</a> at the library</li>
		<li><a href="http://libraries.ucsd.edu/services/requesting/request-for-book-or-journal-article.html">
		Access other</a> <a href="http://www.cdlib.org/services/d2d/ill/myill/">miscellaneous library services</a></li>
	</ol>

<p>Most of these services require you provide other forms of identification to utilize. 
	For example, Sun God registration require PID and full name, Library Accounts
	require a PIN (if it is registered), and group study rooms require a valid @ucsd.edu email.</p>

<p>Some services, however, only require the barcode. Which is why TritonFind takes
	some extra steps to keep your code safe.</p>

</div>

<div id="tritonfind-safety">
<h2>How does TritonFind keep my barcode safe?</h2>

<p>TritonFind has to store barcode information in a database, in order to provide
	the unique services that it performs.</p>

<p>TritonFind "salts and hashes" barcode information. So, even if your
	barcode is "218230596789123", it may appear on TritonFind's database as: </p>

	<p align="center">"0e48dad2000ba9b8ca4483e9e7a28d36a88ae890712f2bd0c80d3bee89b47969"</p>

<p>This is done for two reasons:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>To prevent the TritonFind team from accidentally viewing users' barcode data.</li>
		<li>To impede hacker's attempts from harming our users.</li>
	</ol>
<p>This process is a hash and salt approach. It's similar to how many companies and 
	businesses protect their users' passwords.</p>
</div>

<div id="100-percent">
<h2>Is TritonFind 100% secure?</h2>

<p>For TritonFind's purpose, it is secure enough.</p>

<p>This is what would have to go wrong in order for TritonFind's security to be
	compromised:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>An intruder gains access to the server that TritonFind is ran on.</li> 
		<li>They then break into and steal information from TritonFind's database.</li>
		<li>Then, they spend a ton of resources into reversing the hashing/salting
			algorithms, or attempt a brute-force algorithm to decode the hash.</li>
		<li>Finally, they <u>might</u> have some form of usable data from only some users.</li>
	</ol>
	<br>
	<p>Then, what could a hacker use with this data?
		<br><br>Not much, really. Since they lack other information about you (full names,
		PID, passwords, etc), they can't access services that the barcode provides.
		<br>They could, however, gain unauthorized access some UCSD services. Go
		<a href="#what-can-i-do">here</a> to see how you can protect yourself in
		case of a breach such as this. Also, TritonFind will attempt to contact
		and give any form of aid to users if an event like that happens.
	</p>

	<p><br>But what would be an easier option for a hacker who wants to cause harm?</p>
	<p>Well, maybe they could simply brute force the 
	<a href="https://ucill.vdxhost.com/zportal/zengine?VDXaction=LoginPage">
	UC Systemwide Library ILL service</a>, since no PIN is required (even 
	though other colleges, like UC Davis and UC Santa Barbara, require PIN's),
	a python script could easily break into and scrape student's personal information 
	(like email address and home address).
	This would certainly be easier than breaking into TritonFind's system, would 
	cause more damage, and quite less complex.</p>
</div>

<div id="committment">
	<p>But make no doubt, even though there might be bigger and easier targets out than TritonFind, the 
		TritonFind team is still very, very committed to keeping our service safe
		and secure. Our team strives to keep TritonFind's security measures
		one step ahead, and always keeps the best interests of our users.</p>
</div>


<div id="what-can-i-do">
	<h2>What can I do to keep my and my peers' information safe?</h2>
	
	<ol>
		
		<li>You can make your <a href="https://roger.ucsd.edu/patroninfo">
		UCSD Library Account</a>, to attach a PIN to that account, which would
		prevent other people from using your library resources.</li>
		<li>
		<li>Every few months, you can <a href="https://acms.ucsd.edu/students/gpasswd.html">
		reset your UCSD password</a>. Remember, never use any regular day-to-day
		words in a password, or names of people close to you.</li>
		<li>You could <a href="http://libraries.ucsd.edu/contacts/administrative-contacts.html">
		contact library admin</a> if you are worried about their potential 
		security vulnerabilities.</li>
		<li>Check out the <a href="https://www.github.com/asg017/TritonFind">
		TritonFind source code on Github</a>. Find any security vulnerabilities,
		make recommendations as to how to make TritonFind more secure and better.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Do you really expect me to do all of this just to use TritonFind?</h2>
	<p>No, of course not. You do not need to do any of these extra security steps to 
		use TritonFind. But, in the case of a data leak, either from TritonFind
		or from any other place at UCSD, a peaceful mind always trumps a frantic one.</p>
	
	<h2>I still don't trust you.</h2>
	<p> <a href="contact.html">Hit me up.</a> We can grab some lunch, you can 
		get to know me and my team. You can learn why I decided to make this,
		how I make sure everyone's info is safe. I want to make sure that all
		TritonFind users feel safe and secure, so I'll do whatever it takes to
		make sure your TritonFind experience is worth it.</p>
