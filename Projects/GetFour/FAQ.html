<h1> GetFour Messenger Game FAQ</h1>

<h3> What are the reccomended platforms to play GetFour on? </h3>
<p>  </p>

<h3> Why do my custom emojis look wonky? Why do they sometimes not show up? </h3>
<p> GetFour custom emojis work best when you use the Messenger-specific emojis. These are (supposedly) standard across all devices. If you use your device's custom native emojis (eg. Samsung emojis or iOS emojis), they may appear in a different size/shape than other Messenger-specific emojis. <br>
Also, if you use your device's native emojis (for example, the Apple squirt-gun emoji), this may not appear correctly if you switch devices. If you play GetFour on your iPhone, then set an emoji to the squirt-gun iOS emoji, then later switch to your Android tablet or computer, the emoji may not show up at all. <br>
One last note, iPads specifically have a wonky format when playing GetFour. </p>
