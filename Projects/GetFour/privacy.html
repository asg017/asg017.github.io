	<h1> FourScore Privacy Policy </h1>

	<p> Your privacy is important to us. Here is how to strive to protect that. </p>
<br>
	<h2> Data Collection </h2>
		<p> FourScore uses the Facebook Messenger API to collect specific user information. </p>
		<p> Currently, FourScore has access (and accesses) the following info from each user: <p>
			<li>First Name </li>
			<li>Last Name </li>
			<li>Gender</li>
			<li>Locale</li>
			<li>Profile Picture </li>
		<p> For more info on how FourScore accesses this info, check out <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/user-profile">this page</a> from the Messenger API docs. </p>

		<p> We store the above data in a database (sans profile picture). We obtain this data the moment a user first contacts us, either by direct message or by pressing the "Get Started" button. We get a user's profile picture only when needed, using the Messenger API. </p>

		<p> We will never share any information with 3rd parties, including marketers or advertisers. </p>

		<p> We can, however, share anonymymized data with nonprofit entities for the sole purpose of analyzing data, such at high school/college clubs. All Personal Identifing Infornation (PII) will be stripped away and be replaced with mock-up information, ensuring the privacy for all users. </p>


		<p> We do not store the specific messages a user sends to FourScore. It can, however, be accessed by our team using Facebook's Page Messaging system. That system will only be accessed for: </p>
			<li> Quality Control </li>
			<li> Debugging </li>
			<li> Report Follow-ups </li>

		<p> If a user requests to see all data stored pertaining to their interactions with FourScore, it will be provided. Contact our team <a href="https://asg017.github.io/FourScore/Contact.html">here</a>. We will provide all data that we have for these users. We can also delete all information for a user if requested.</p>

<br>
	<h2> In Game Privacy </h2>
		
		<p> When a user creates a new game, they can either create a game with friends (by sharing a specific code with their peers) or by random connection. FourScore strives to protect user's privacy in both of these steps. </p>

		<p> When a user creates a game with a friend, they can see the other player's full name and profile picture. This is done because it is expected that when a user joins a game via a game-specific game ID, they received this game ID from their friend, meaning they already know each other. So, it is expected that a friend can see another friend's full name and profile picture. </p>

		<p> When a user joins a random game, however, this expectation is not there. They do not know the other player. So, they will only be able to access the person's first name and last initial, and their profile picture. This is done in the hopes of preventing the other player from gettings into contact with the other user (by looking them up on Facebook). </p>

<br>
	<h2> Player-to-Player Contact </h2>
		
		<p> Eventually, users will have the option to message other players in the same game. </p>
		<p> These player-to-player messages will not be stored in a database on FourScore's side. But, these messages do leave an imprint on FourScore's logging system. These log are kept secure and secret, ensuring no private communications will be compromised. </p>
		<p> These player-to-player messages are also accessible through the Facebook Page Messaging system. We only access this system in the reasons detailed above (under "Data Connection"). We may incidently see these private messages, but any messages we accidentally see will be kept confidential. If we need to debug player-to-player messaging, we will do so within are own team, and not on a normal user's thread (unless explicit permission is given) </p>
		
		<p> The FourScore team will access player-to-player communications on Facebook's Page Messaging system to investigate reports filed by players. If a user files a report against another user, we may view these communications to determine if another user abused the Terms of Service of FourScore. If this is done, all messages read by the FourScore team will be kept confidential, and effected users will be notified of the investigation. </p>
		<p> Keep in mind we are not the only one's with access to these player-to-player messaages. Facebook and its Messenger team most likely has access to all of FourScore's messages, and therefore access to player-to-player communications. We do not take responsibility for what the Messenger Team does with these messages. </p>

<br>
	<h2> Updates </h2>
		<p> If this privacy policy significantly changes, we will update all of our users using our Annoucement System through FourScore. We will also make a post on the FourScore Facebook page.</p>

		<p> If you feel that we are not abiding by this policy, or have any questions in general about FourScore and its data collection policies, please contact our team <a href="https://asg017.github.io/FourScore/Contact.html">here</a>.
