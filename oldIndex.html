			Hello world! My name is Alex Garcia, and I am currently a second year 
			at UCSD. For my first summer in college, I'm trying to kill some 
			time by picking up HTML/CSS/Javascript. As you can see, right now, I don't 
			have much to offer, but expect for this to be updated frequently!
		</p>
	
		<p>
			I hope to see from you soon, with a better website!
