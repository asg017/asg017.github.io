  <h1>College, Major, and Gender at UC San Diego</h1>
  <span>Analyzing how different academic identities intersect at UCSD in La Jolla.</span>
  
  <div id="scroll-main-container">
    
    <div id="intro" class="story scroll-section">
      <p>At the end of Week 3 of each academic quarter at UCSD, the Registrar's office puts out their "Final Registration Reports," giving insight to the makeup of the UC San Diego student population.</p>
    
      <p>The most insightful report in this giant list of reports is called REGCAM05, which shows how many students are in each major, department, and college, as well as their gender and their school year.</p>

            <div class="step text-scroll-div">
              With the REGCAM05 report, we get 5 distinct academic identites to analyze: <b>Year</b>, <b>Gender</b>, <b>College</b>, <b>Department</b>, and <b>Major</b>.
            </div>
            <div class="step text-scroll-div">
              First: <b>Year</b>. Now, UCSD defines a student's "year" based on how many units they complete, wtih 36 units per year. So, Freshmen have completed between 0-35 academic units, Sophomores 36-71, and so on.<br/>
              However, this doesn't coorespond to how many years a student has been at UCSD. Incoming first year freshmen (or transfers) with a lot of AP/IB credit or community college classes under their belt may have more than 36 units before they step foot on campus.
              Also, not all students do 36 units per year. Some students do 20+ units per quarter, some students may take a quarter off, others might do summer classes. For example, I've only done two years at UCSD, but I have "Senior" academic standing, and I'm probably going to take 3 more years to graduate (meaning I'll be a "Senior" for three years).
            </div>
            <div class="step text-scroll-div">
              Next, <b>Gender</b>. One thing to note, UCSD only reports "Male" or "Female", and does not report any other gender identities.
            </div>
            <div class="step text-scroll-div">
              Then, <b>College.</b>. UC San Diego operates on a six-college system. I won't go too in depth with this, but a student's college is not based on their major or department, it is (ideally) independent from that.
            </div>
            
            <div class="step text-scroll-div">
              Finally, <b>Department</b> and <b>Major</b>. Just a small note, the data in this essay does not include double or triple majors (or minors, for that manner).
            </div>
