	<p>
		Hello world! My name is Alex Garcia, and I am currently a second year 
		at UCSD. For my first summer in college, I'm trying to kill some 
		time by picking up HTML/CSS/Javascript. As you can see, right now, I don't 
		have much to offer, but expect for this to be updated frequently!
	</p>

	<p>
		I hope to see from you soon, with a better website!
